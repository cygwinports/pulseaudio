sdesc: "PulseAudio sound server"
ldesc: "PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is 
a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced 
operations on your sound data as it passes between your application and 
your hardware. Things like transferring the audio to a different 
machine, changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several 
sounds into one are easily achieved using a sound server."
